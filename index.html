        <h3>Data Analyst - Hitachi Payment Services Pvt. Ltd.</h3>
        <span class="duration">July 2024 - June 2025 💼 Full time</span>
        <p>
          🔹 Automated Cash Logistics Optimization:
          Developed a Python-based cost analysis scheduler that crunched through two months of Sunday and holiday indent
          data, smartly categorizing manual vs. system-generated cases. This led to a 15% cost reduction and ~10% drop
          in avoidable CIT indents, thanks to automated root-cause detection and interactive HTML-based reporting
          dashboards.
          <br>
          🔹 Real-Time ATM Fault Diagnostics:
          Built Python diagnostic tools to detect faulty cassette configurations across live ATMs, triggering instant
          alerts for the ops team. This innovation drove a 15%+ cut in ATM cash-out incidents, faster fault resolution,
          fewer penalty cases, and a clear boost in revenue retention.
          <br>
          🔹 Forecasting for Smarter Operations:
          Engineered ATM evacuation forecast scripts that automated 10-day and 30-day cash planning, factoring in
          weekday/weekend trends and rolling dispense data. This eliminated ~40% of manual Excel work and significantly
          accelerated operations planning cycles.
          <br>
          🔹 Data Reliability & Pipeline Monitoring:
          Monitored ETL workflows to maintain >80% on-time data refreshes for the SBI account, reducing operational risk
          by ~25%. Also implemented automated root-cause analysis tools to diagnose and prevent forecast failures before
          they impacted business decisions.

        <h3>ML Engineer - Ramdisk.io</h3>
        <span class="duration">Jan 2023 - June 2024 💼 Full time</span>
        <p>
          🔹 Real-Time Object Detection:
          Deployed and fine-tuned YOLO models for desktop-based, real-time object detection using Python and OpenCV -
          achieving 75%+ accuracy with sub-200ms latency on live video feeds. Enabled smooth, real-time analytics for
          camera-based applications.
          <br>
          🔹 Edge AI for Safety Monitoring:
          Developed and integrated a TensorFlow Lite-based helmet detection system on Raspberry Pi, optimized for
          low-power environments. Reduced safety violation detection time by ~40% in real-world conditions, enabling
          rapid, on-device decision-making.
          <br>
          🔹 On-Device Image Classification:
          Built custom TensorFlow models for multi-class image classification in Android applications, delivering >85%
          accuracy through efficient on-device inference. Streamlined deployment pipelines for scalable edge-AI
          applications.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">🎬 Local RAG Chatbot</h3>
        <p>
          A fully local AI chatbot that understands and talks about movies - powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
          (RAG) pipeline built from scratch.
          <br>
          Runs completely offline using TinyLlama (1.1B) — optimized to fit on an NVIDIA 1650 (4 GB VRAM) setup.
          <br>
          Uses Chroma Vector Store + Sentence Transformers to perform lightning-fast semantic retrieval on local movie
          data.
          <br>
          Built with LangChain to handle contextual reasoning, prompt flow, and grounded responses.
          <br>
          Can answer natural queries like “List Nolan's top-rated thrillers” or “What's the IMDB rating for Inception?”
          - all from your local dataset.
          <br>
          Designed for privacy-first and low-resource AI applications, showing how advanced LLM workflows can thrive on
          modest hardware.
          <br>
          Scalable beyond movies — adaptable for books, company wikis, or offline knowledge assistants.
          <br>
          🧠 A glimpse of the future where powerful AI stays local, private, and personalized.
